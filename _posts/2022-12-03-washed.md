Hey.

Why haven't I posted here in another month? Well, the reason is a little different this time...

Yeah, I dropped almost 400 rating points on Codeforces since my last post. This isn't actually [my first time]({{site.baseurl}}/winter-break) dropping out of red. But unlike last time, I didn't come back up immediately after. I originally wanted to wait until I got back to red to resume writing on this blog. But that might take longer than expected. Or never happen again.

I wasn't sure if I wanted to write about this subject at first. Cause it's depressing to come to terms with. But I felt it would be good to document my thoughts in the current moment, if nothing else just to vent and write things down for myself. Or so I can look back in a few months and see what has changed, so I can see what worked and what didn't.

I could rant about what wrong in each of my last 4 contests in great detail. Tell you about what I tried on this problem or that problem, or where things went awry. But I think there's a more fundamental problem. I've entered a slump. A negative feedback loop where I fail to solve problems, so I feel dumb, so I fail to solve even easier problems the next time, so I feel even dumber, and so on. I don't even know how to properly describe it. It's like my thinking is severely clouded than before. Problems in a difficulty range that used to solve themselves suddenly feel really hard.

I decided to document my thought process. Outside of contest, I opened a problem in attempts of solving it (not on Codeforces because I don't want to have anything to do with that fucked up account at the moment), and typed all my thoughts in a notepad. I did this a few times. For problems that I immediately got the right idea for, everything went smoothly. I can still code stuff, I haven't forgotten that part. But the moment I don't start off with the correct approach to a problem, everything seems to be derailed. A minute becomes 10 minutes, then half an hr. And although I think I'm doing a lot of unique thinking, when I look back at my notes, it's really just many variations on the same fundamentally wrong start. Yes, I know I'm not supposed to get stuck on one approach; it's what I tell others all the time, and now I'm not practicing what I preach. Maybe it's because subconsciously, my ego won't accept it when I make a wrong initial approach. Because only someone unskilled with poor intuition would do that. So I'm determined to make it work, even if it just can't work. Or maybe it's tunnel vision. When I don't know the solution, I also don't know where my thinking is relative to the start and end. So when I think I've gone back up enough steps in the thinking tree, I haven't really reached the root. I haven't truly tried a new idea. It's also hard to forget what you've already thought about before and just move on to something new. Because that something old just lingers in the back of your mind.

It's also hard to remain confident. I don't remember what it's like to succeed anymore. What a good performance feels like. I look back at my old contest record, and it looks like a different person. Like, was that me who did well in all those competitions? And so now I'm engaging in some sort of fucked up self-fulfilling prophecy, where I have convinced myself that I am no longer all that. Every step forward comes with several steps back. I might get +1 confidence point for solving a problem in practice, but then instantly -10 when I fail to solve one.

Ok, so then it's simple. Stop caring about rating. That doesn't work though. It's like telling someone to get over their ex. Like, you know it's the correct decision. Doesn't mean your mind will let you forget. And my enjoyment of the game has always been tied to rating. I'm a competitive person. I play to win and climb the ladder. Frankly, if Codeforces was just a problem archive and had no rated contests, I wouldn't do it. Perhaps that's the issue. I enjoy the contest more than the problems. Don't get me wrong, I like cool ideas, cool problems, cool algorithms. That's the entire existence of this blog. But it's hard for me to enjoy the problems independently of the contest. Does this mean my enjoyment of competitive programming is inherently more superficial than those who truly love the art of problem solving? I guess so. Because my enjoyment is too closely aligned with results, perception of myself, and is thus too malleable.

I have a lot more to write about this subject. My thoughts on intelligence based games, our evaluation of self worth based on our perceived intelligence, whatever. That is certainly for another time though. A time when I am no longer at the center of the subject, and I can talk about it as a faraway third party.

I will end this post with some positivity so that the whole thing isn't just a depressive rant. Outside of CP, life is quite nice. I'm finally not overwhelmed with classwork anymore as regular classes come to an end and finals season approaches at my university (which is ironically more relaxed for me than usual). Winter break and the end of the semester is finally coming. And I've also expanded more time into my other hobbies aside from CP. Back in [September]({{site.baseurl}}/update), I mentioned that I got into bouldering. I've been doing it for 3 months now, and it's still as fun as ever! When I first started, I was bad enough to fall off some V1s, but I've gotten stronger every single time I've gone to the gym and recently even flashed a V4 for the first time, which was super hype! And I couldn't do a pull up at the start of the semester, but I can now! Getting good at a sport also just feels good. You feel physically better about yourself. Living a sedentary lifestyle and spending many of your waking hours in front of a computer feels so imprisoning at times.

What am I going to do about CP? Idk. I can't quit yet. My work here isn't done. There's a wrong to be righted. My CF profile. But that's in the long term. In the short term, I'm forcing myself to stop before I tilt down to purple.

Ok, that's all I have to say for now. Goodbye now. I shall publish this and go to sleep before I change my mind about posting.
